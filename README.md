# LAB | Vue.js Form Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll start exploring how Vue.js works and how to modify a regular project with this web development framework.

We'll be following the official Vue.js guide for most of this lab.

## Setup

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin main # or master if you are working from a master
  ```
- Create a Pull Request so that your TAs can check your work.

## What should we do?

The first step is to create an `index.js` file where to control your Vue-app. Once that is done, we must initialize it and define it in our `index.html`. 
<br>

Manage your ids to control them from vue and create your methods to send the form information. We must validate the form information and create error messages based on the value entered in the input. 

Be careful with the default behavior of the form!
```
Hint: event.preventDefault()
```

‚ùóÔ∏è Oh! don't forget to put the header with the information in order to send the Deta request. Here is the information you should use.
